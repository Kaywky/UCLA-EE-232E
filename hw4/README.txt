1) The problems’ solution are named as problem_X.R respectively. For problem 5, you need to run the first half of problem5.R and then problem5.python, and finally, the second half of problem5.R.
2) We have attached the results of problems in “data” directory:
p1_correlations.csv as correlation matrix for daily time series data in problem1;
adj_matrix.csv as adjacency matrix for daily time series data in problem2;
valid_sector.csv as 494 valid stocks’ name;
dup_mst.txt as duplicated MST graph edge-list in problem5;
tsp_name.txt as nodes’ names of Eulerian path in problem5;
p6_correlations.csv as correlation matrix for weekly time series data in problem 6;
p6_adj_matrix.csv as adjacency matrix for weekly time series data in problem6;
