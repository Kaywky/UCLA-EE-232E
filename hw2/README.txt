1) All solutions for 4 problems are saved as problem_X.R, which can be run in R environment.
2) To be convenient, for each problem, we write certain functions in R script, which can be called directly with different parameters, like nodes number, damping value, etc. Thus, if you want to try different value, just change the parameters passed in the function.
3) All results will be printed or plotted directly.
